This is a reminder from the mod team to please remember Rule 1 as you participate in this thread. Be respectful and keep comments on topic. There will be zero tolerance for anything even approaching a Rule 1 violation. This includes (but is not limited to): flamebaiting, sealioning, prolonging arguments that have run their course, calling someone’s comment stupid instead of the person themselves, and accusations of shilling. It doesn’t matter what side of the argument you’re on, whether you believe you have the moral high ground, or if the other person escalated things first.

To be very clear: Bans will be handed out without warning at the moderators’ discretion. This comment is your warning. Take this seriously, folks.
